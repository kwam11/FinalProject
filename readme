READ ME!

Welcome to my repository for my analysis of macaroni penguin metabolic proxies. 

To simulate the full  analysis, go into the "src" folder and run the "source.R" script. Make sure the repository is your present working directory when doing so.

To view figures or test analysis output, go to the "results folder"

To view raw data of the study, go to the "data" folder

If for some reason data and/or figures are not present in the folders, run the "script.R" file with the repository as your pwd and they will automatically be generated and saved to those locations



--Thank you!
